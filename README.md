# satz-algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures used by the [swift-rohan](https://github.com/satzlich/swift-rohan) project.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

The algorithms include:

| Algorithm               | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Binary Search           | Counterpart of `std::upper_bound` and `std::lower_bound` in C++. |
| Topological Sort        | Implementation of Kahn's algorithm and Algorithm T (from TAOCP). |
| Greatest Common Divisor | Implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.                       |

The data structures include:

| Data Structure      | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Ternary Search Tree | A balanced search tree with three children per node. |
| Trie                | A prefix tree for storing strings.                   |
| Inverted Index      | A data structure for efficient text search.          |
